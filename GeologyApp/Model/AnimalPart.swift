 //image name? then pass head & access animalPart.name + animalPart.name (head & body names) to say: UIImage(named: animalPart.name + animalPart.name)?
    
}*/

//have an array of Traits (enum type) as a field? where would you declare the animals? in the head/body controller then pass them along in segue?
//in last/score screen: case/switch for each thing pressed? tho there are only so many options for each animal, why have it iterate thru each possible case?
